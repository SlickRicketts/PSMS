# PSMS
This is the Project Submission Management System, worked on in 2024 during my senior year at Franklin College, in Franklin, Indiana.

Admin is able to add, modify, and delete all users and projects on the system.

Students can upload any project they work on for mentorship from anyone outside of the Franklin College Network. 
Students are only able to see what projects they have uploaded.

Staff members also have these features as well. 

Mentors are able to view all projects that have been uploaded.
